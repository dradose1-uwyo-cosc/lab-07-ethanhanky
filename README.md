## Worked with/sources 
* I worked with the User input while loops, and the function power points
* Then I would use Chat GPT for when my code would not work
## Project Quirks/ Things that don't work
* I named my user input variable "input" which would make my code unable to work because its the same as the 'input' function in python
* I had trouble organizing all of my if statments which i struggled with for a while
